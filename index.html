	<p>Artist Alison Saar has created a monumental figurative bronze sculpture for the exterior plaza to serve as a companion piece to the historic Hall of Justice. In her own words, Saar says of the artwork, “Embodied represents the spirit of Justice. She is not a typical depiction, for she wields no sword, wears no blindfold. Her lucid eyes are blind to creed and color. She is all seeing in issues of truth and equity. She weighs and balances the book of the law and equates it to freedom and peace, as affirmed by the dove taking flight from her upheld hand.”</p>

        Your private repository will now be made public. Keep in mind that
        making a repository public means that anyone on the internet can view
        and access the code. If your repository had any forks, those will also
        become public. Ensure that you are aware of the implications and
        potential security concerns associated with making a repository public,
        especially if it contains sensitive information.
