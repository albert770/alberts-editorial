      <h2>Embodied</h2>

	<p>Artist Alison Saar has created a monumental figurative bronze sculpture for the exterior plaza to serve as a companion piece to the historic Hall of Justice. In her own words, Saar says of the artwork, “Embodied represents the spirit of Justice. She is not a typical depiction, for she wields no sword, wears no blindfold. Her lucid eyes are blind to creed and color. She is all seeing in issues of truth and equity. She weighs and balances the book of the law and equates it to freedom and peace, as affirmed by the dove taking flight from her upheld hand.”</p>

    <p>The figure’s facial features are a composite of many ethnicities, according to Saar representing the diverse populations of Los Angeles County. Draped over one arm, she holds a long braid
        meant to symbolize the coming together of the many facets of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department to ensure a secure and peaceful
        environment. Imprinted on her dress are over 200 words gathered from conversations with staff of the Sheriff’s Department, the District Attorney’s Office, schools and courthouses. Saar also
        spent time in Grand Park downtown and asked a random sampling of people for their input. More than a dozen languages are included on the sculpture.</p>

        <p>Saar and a team of over 30 artisans, bronze casters and engineers were involved in the making of the artwork. From start to finish, the team transformed a 12 inch clay model to a life and a half scale bronze sculpture weighing over one ton. Embodied was made entirely within Los Angeles County, including Decker Studios bronze foundry in North Hollywood and Exclusive Welding in La Crescenta.</p>

        <h2>Pentimento</h2>
        <h3>by Erin Shie Palmer (2010s)</h3>
    </header>
    <div>
        <p>Pentimento adorns a wall in the garden area between two of the LA County Coroner’s buildings. Seven years in the making, the artwork consists of 300 hand-blown glass bells in varying shades of blue. For visitors and employees taking a mind-clearing stroll, Pentimento offers the opportunity for a more focused meditative moment. The artist drew upon the inspiration of shrines and wishing walls. She chose bells for their central role in many cultures’ rituals, from the joyous to the mournful. Not only do the bells’ hues subtly vary, but each one creates a distinct note when the wind blows. The tranquil sound they make collectively is meant to remind visitors of moving water, a life-giving force with particular resonance in such a setting. “I seek to heighten awareness of place,” Palmer has written, adding that she aims to make “visible that [which] exists beneath the threshold of the readily apparent.”</p>

        <h2>Untitled (Whitter Narrows Sculptures)</h2>
        <h3>by Benjamin Dominguez (early 1960s)</h3>
    </header>
    <div>
        <p>At dusk, a strange silhouette seems to emerge from Legg Lake. Its spiny back looms 20 feet long and its neck stretches toward the darkening horizon. From a distance a mother's call grows more urgent with the descending darkness, but her children do not respond. Their young bodies cling to the sea creature's back; they shriek from the animal's tail. But there's no need for alarm -- the kids are having too much fun to mind their mother who insists its time to go home. The creature wears a friendly smile and its head is covered in a colorful cap. Its surface is smooth, made of cement and glazed with paint. It is one of numerous sculptures of sea creatures that have called the Whittier Narrows Parks their home for well over half a century. They are part of a collection of site-specific cement park installations by Mexican artist Benjamin Dominguez.</p>

        <p>These fantastic sea creatures have played an important historic role in integrating the once newly-created Whittier Narrows Parks into the contested landscape. They attracted visitors and potential residents to the newly developed housing communities during the dawn of Southern California's post war suburbanization. The creation of these parks transformed the area from an untamed floodplain that nestled numerous immigrant communities, to a network of cemented channels; curated parks with newly demarcated cities along its perimeter.</p>

        <p>As the entire region was being re-imagined and reconstructed, Benjamin Dominguez's sea creature sculptures invited visitors into a unique kind of oasis, one that for decades has provided thousands of people with respite from the urban environment, while infusing the landscape with magic. Their maker, Benjamin Dominguez, a trained artist from Mexico City, knew how to mold the materials that have shaped much of the modern environment's hard surfaces into visions of fantasy.</p>
